Physical activity recognition is a comprehensive study that intends to identify a person's actions based on sensor data. In this project, activity recognition is expressed as a classification task where two traditional machine learning algorithms are analysed based on their precision and accuracy. Extra features are also created to examine the impact on the modelâ€™s performance. As a result, K Nearest Neighbour is found to perform consistently well in identifying distinct activities. 

#### Files
Notebook.ipynb is the main project file that is divided into 3 sections:

- Data Preparation contains codes used for data preparation task.

- Data Exploration contains all codes used to explore data resulting in different visualisations.

- Data Modeling contains all codes used for data modeling (classification task) and results.

#### Data File

- All data files are retrieved from <b> UCI Machine Learning Repository</b> and are stored in Activity Recognition from Single Chest Mounted Accelerometer

- Preprocessed data are stored as preprocessed_data.csv file
